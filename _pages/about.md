My name is YOUR NAME and I'm currently completing a Computer Science/IT/Software Engineering degree at [RMIT University](http://www.rmit.edu.au/) in [Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne). I'm in my XXXXX year and will be completing my studies in 201X.

You can find my [Github Profile here](https://github.com/thundergolfer) and my [LinkedIn Profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathonbelotti/).

**My Current Project is: PROJECT NAME**

This is a project description it has stuff in it about what tech your project uses, what problems it solves, blah, blah, blah. Here is a short second sentence. That's about all we need.
